# Basic Node.js Chat Room

This is a simple local group chat application built with Node.js for the server and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for the client. This project demonstrates how a basic chat system works, making it easy to understand and build upon.

## Features
- Real-time local chat
- Browser-based user interface
- Node.js server

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor

## Running the Project

1. Open the project folder in VS Code (or your preferred code editor) or use a file manager.

2. Open a terminal inside the folder named `server`:
   - In VS Code, right-click the `server` folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal."
   - Alternatively, hold `Ctrl + Shift` and right-click inside the folder, then choose "Open Terminal Here."

3. Run the server by typing the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   
4. Open multiple browser windows or tabs on the same computer to start chatting.


## Recommended Improvements

- Add user authentication
- Enable chat history
- Support for external connections (beyond the local computer)
